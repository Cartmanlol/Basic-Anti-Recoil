# Basic-Anti-Recoil ***OPEN AS ADMIN FOR BEST EXPERINCE***
i made this for r6 but it works on any game read the read me.
it works by using your dpi 
when you first open it it will ask for your dpi type it in then it make a txt called dpi.txt and thats where your dpi is stored so if you ever need to change it just open that and change it
it also explains how to use it when you open it
but to enable it click caps so its enabled then hold down left and right click on your mouse, and it you want to turn it off but not to close it just turn off caps its simple.
if you have and questions, or need help add me on discord winzalldaygl#8807
